Most of the world's population lives in cities, which frequently face administrative challenges in the most diverse areas. Governments and city planners can significantly benefit from the increasing amount of data collected by ubiquitous and unobtrusive sensors networks. Recently, NYC government has shared a vast amount of data that has been collected over the years. Among those are taxi and weather datasets. In this project we tried to find correlations between these two elements of the city. We developed a framework consisting in data aggregation with Spark and a web­based interactive visualization tool, which enabled us to identify interesting patterns in new yorker's behaviour.
